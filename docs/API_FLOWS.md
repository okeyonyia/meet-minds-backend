## üïí **Time Slot Filtering**

Both events and personal dining support time-based filtering:

### Time Slots Available:
- **`morning`**: 5:00 AM - 11:59 AM (breakfast, brunch, coffee)
- **`afternoon`**: 12:00 PM - 5:59 PM (lunch, afternoon tea) 
- **`night`**: 6:00 PM - 4:59 AM (dinner, late night)

### Usage Examples:
```bash
# Morning events
GET /event?time_slot=morning

# Night personal dining experiences
GET /personal-dining/public?time_slot=night

# Combine with other filters
GET /event?time_slot=afternoon&text=business&capacity=6
```

## ‚è∞ **Time Conflict Prevention**

Users cannot accept/request dining experiences within **2 hours** of existing accepted experiences:

### Conflict Rules:
- 2-hour buffer before and after any accepted experience
- Applies to both direct invitations and join requests
- Prevents double-booking and ensures travel time
- Users can accept new experiences 3+ hours after existing ones end

### Example:
‚úÖ **Allowed**: User has dinner 6-8 PM, can accept lunch starting at 11 AM next day  
‚ùå **Blocked**: User has dinner 6-8 PM, cannot accept another dinner at 9:30 PM  
‚úÖ **Allowed**: User has dinner 6-8 PM, can accept late dinner starting at 11 PM
